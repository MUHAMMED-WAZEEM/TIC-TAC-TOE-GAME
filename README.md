Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java. The game allows two players to take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who successfully places three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the board fills up without a winner, the game is a draw.
